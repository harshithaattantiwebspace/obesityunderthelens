This project explores how socioeconomic factors like income, education, and race are linked to obesity in the US. Obesity rates are higher in low-income, undereducated populations due to limited access to healthy food, exercise, and medical care. We aim to quantify pathways to obesity, identify high-risk groups, and inform public health strategies.
